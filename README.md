# Social App - Rivia
> The guiding idea of the project is to allow users to search for interested people to spend time together in an activity that interests them.
In the designed system it is possible to create events with a specified theme with a limited number of participants.
The possibility of communication between interested people has also been taken into account, as well as the option to reject or accept requests.
The product is adapted to devices of different sizes thanks to the use of Responsive Web Design when designing the application views.
The target group for the application is unlimited, anyone looking for people willing to develop twin passions and interests together can find the application for themselves.
